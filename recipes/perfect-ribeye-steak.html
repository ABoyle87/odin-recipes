    <h3><em>Perfect, Easy Ribeye Steak butter basted in a cast iron skillet with rosemary. An error-proof medium rare in 20 minutes including rest time.</em></h3>  
<p>When it comes to Beef Recipes, a hearty perfectly cooked steak will impress every time. This is an easy and classic steak preparation, just like popular favorites Cube Steak with Gravy, Steak Au Poivre, and Easy Salisbury Steak.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 16- ounce ribeye steaks , 1 ½ inch thick</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon coarse ground black peppe</li>
    <li>3 rosemary sprigs</li>
  </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 500 degrees.</li>
    <li>Add the butter to a cast iron skillet on high heat.</li>
    <li>Add the Kosher salt and black pepper to the steaks and add to the pan.</li>
    <li>Sear the steaks on high heat for 30 seconds on each side.</li>
    <li>Add the rosemary sprigs to the top of the steaks and spoon over the butter onto the steaks.</li>
    <li>Put the pan with the steaks into the oven for 4-5 minutes (if you'd like you can flip them halfway through – I don't and you can see how mine have cooked through).</li>
    <li>Rest for five minutes before serving.</li>
  </ol>
<h1><em>Enjoy!</em></h1>
